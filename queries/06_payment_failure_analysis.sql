/* ### Q6 — Payment Failure Analysis (Method × Top Error Code)

**Payments PM question:** *“Which payment methods fail most, and what’s the top reason?”*

**Output:** `payment_method, attempts, failures, failure_rate, top_error_code, top_error_message, top_error_share_of_failures`

**Sanity check:** `failure_rate` and `top_error_share_of_failures` both in `[0, 1]`.

**Pattern note:** Two CTEs. CTE 1 aggregates attempts/failures per method. CTE 2 ranks error codes per method with `row_number() over (partition by payment_method order by error_count desc)` and filters `rn = 1`. Then join. A `group by` alone cannot pick the top error per method — this is the classic top-N-per-group pattern, a top-5 SQL interview question.
