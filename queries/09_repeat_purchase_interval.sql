/* ### Q9 — Repeat Purchase Interval

**Lifecycle Marketing question:** *“How long until a customer comes back? When should we send the win-back email?”*

**Output (row-level):** `customer_id, order_id, order_date, next_order_date, days_to_next_order`**Output (summary):** `avg_days_to_next_order, median_days_to_next_order, p90_days_to_next_order, customers_with_repeat_order`

**Sanity check:** `days_to_next_order >= 0` on every row. `median <= p90` in the summary.

**Pattern note:** `lead(created_at) over (partition by customer_id order by created_at)`. Filter out the last order per customer (`next_order_date IS NULL`) from the summary — including them biases the average toward infinity. You will also find a fat cluster of near-zero intervals: customers who split one shopping session into multiple orders minutes apart. Decide whether a same-day follow-up order counts as “coming back” (hint: a win-back email is irrelevant to it), compute the summary both ways, and document the choice — this single decision moves the median by days.
